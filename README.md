# Mission statement 

The goal of SimpleTimeTrack is to make time tracking as simple and quick as possible.

# Background

Many people struggle with time tracking software which is targeted not at the person tracking his/her time efficiently but on management to provide statistics etc.
To remedy this, there already are some great projects (like http://ti.sharats.me/ ) but they lack some features like integration of other time tracking software.

# Features of SimpleTimeTrack

- modular design to allow easy extension
- simple setup: no complicated installation, just download and start tracking times
