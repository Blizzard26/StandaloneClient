# This is an example properties file
# Lines starting with the hash sign "#" and empty lines are ignored

# Put this file to $HOME/.stt/.sttrc and it will be used automatically

# You can use environment variables anywhere you like if they are enclosed by dollar signs ($).

# Paths can be specified with slashes "/" or backslashes "\"

# Example:
# tiFile=$HOME$/.ti-sheet

# all values below show their default

# If you want to read existing ti files, set this to the absolute or relative path of the file
#tiFile=$HOME$/.ti-sheet

# The same goes for an existing ti-current file:
#tiCurrentFile=$HOME$/.ti-sheet-current

# The file where time tracking is persisted to
#sttFile=$HOME$/.stt

# the width of output on the CLI: Comments will be truncated, so everything fits into to this width
# cliReportingWidth=80

# if you get funny output with umlauts or other non ASCII characters on the Windows CMD,
# set sysoutEncoding=CP850
#sysoutEncoding=UTF-8

# comments which should be regarded as break time. The values are case sensitive and may contain white space but must not contain commas
#breakTimeComments=pause,break,coffee

# the file where working time specifications are stored
#workingTimesFile=$HOME$/.stt_worktimes

# The interval in hh:mm:ss that durations in reports are rounded to

#backupLocation=$HOME$

# backup interval in days. 0 will disable backups
#backupInterval=7

# backup retention count. This specifies how many backup files will remain. The oldest ones are automatically deleted until this many files remain.
# 0 disables deletion of old backup files.
# WARNING: this will delete files with name .stt-YYYY-mm-dd regardless who created them. If in doubt, leave this set to 0 and delete old backup files yourself.
