# example entries:

# implement later: worktime for the date is 8-10h
# if actual working time is less than 8h, the difference is subtracted from current overtime
# if actual working time is more than 10h, the difference is added to current overtime
# if actual working time is between 8h and 10h, current overtime is not modified
